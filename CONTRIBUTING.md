# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Awesome AI Local Tools!

## Adding a New Tool

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

### Requirements

1. **Must run locally** - The tool should be able to run on the user's own hardware without requiring cloud services for core functionality.
2. **Open source preferred** - Open source tools are preferred, but proprietary tools with free tiers that work offline are acceptable.
3. **Active project** - The project should be actively maintained (commits within the last 12 months).
4. **Quality** - The tool should be functional and provide value to users.

### Format

- Use the following format: `[Tool Name](link) - Short description.`
- Keep descriptions concise and clear (one line, ending with a period).
- Add new items in alphabetical order within their category.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

### Pull Request Process

1. Search previous suggestions before making a new one to avoid duplicates.
2. Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
3. Use the following commit message format: `Add [Tool Name]`
4. The pull request title should be: `Add [Tool Name]`
5. Include a link to the tool and why it should be included.

### Updating Your PR

If the maintainers notice anything that needs to be changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before merging it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit the existing one.
